# annostring - String Utilities for JavaScript

`annostring` provides a set of string utilities for JavaScript. The functions have been [annotated](https://github.com/annojs/annotate) and provide nice runtime errors. This might have a slight effect on performance, though, but I believe the convenience is worth it.
